# Company Recommender Algorithm

We have a database with datapoints as different companies and their features as the foudnign year, valuation, country of origin etc. 
Based on this information, we have written a script for quantifying the similarity between different companies by way of a combined similarity metric. 
Also, the algorithm computes the similarity when a partiular feature (country of origin, founding year etc is selected)
