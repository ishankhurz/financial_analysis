# Company Recommender Algorithm

We have a database with datapoints as different companies and their features as the founding year, company valuation, country of origin etc. 
Based on this information, we have written a script for quantifying the similarity between different companies by way of a combined similarity metric. 
Also, the algorithm computes the similarity separately when a partiular feature (country of origin, founding year etc) is selected.
